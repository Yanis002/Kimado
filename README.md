# Kimado

C++ port attempt of my [multi-platform Zelda: Ocarina of Time Mod Helper](https://github.com/Yanis42/Cole).

This project's name is the french translation of Cole, which comes from a character of Zelda: Spirit Tracks.

## Requirements
The following packages are required: ``qt6-tools-dev libgl-dev qt6-wayland``

Notes:
- on Ubuntu you will need to perform [these steps](https://askubuntu.com/a/1460243)
- ``uic`` is used to generate a buildable file for the UI (with ``make ui``), you may need to install the package ``designer-qt6``
